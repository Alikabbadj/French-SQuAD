# French-SQuAD : French Machine Reading for Question Answering

# Abstract

This paper proposes to unlock the main barrier to machine reading and comprehension French natural language
texts. This open the way to machine to find to a question a precise answer buried in the mass of unstructured French
texts. Or to create a universal French chatbot. Deep learning has produced extremely promising results for various
tasks in natural language understanding particularly topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and
language translation. But to be effective Deep Learning methods need very large training datasets. Until now these
technics cannot be actually used for French texts Question Answering (Q&A) applications since there was not a large
Q&A training dataset. We produced a large (100 000+) French training Dataset for Q&A by translating and adapting
the English SQuAD v1.1 Dataset, a GloVe French word and character embedding vectors from Wikipedia French
Dump. We trained and evaluated of three different Q&A neural network architectures in French and carried out a
French Q&A models with F1 score around 70%.
